# black-hole

## Overview

This is an android two-player strategy game which uses a computer player implemented for a game known as [blackhole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMLE7a3faI4). This was the workshop of Google's Applied CS with android.

## Data Structures and Algorithms used

A combination of the min-max algorithm and monte-carlo were used to implement the computer player. Although the min-max algorithm would yeild the most optimal solution, in favor of time efficiency, monte-carlo was used until only 4 moves are left in the game. After that, the computer's next move is determined by the min-max algorithm.
